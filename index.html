    <h3 class="title">Why Africa?</h3>
    <p>For a considerable portion of human history, Africa has been overlooked as a key region for foreign investments due to two key reasons. The first being that there is a longer time horizon to see one’s return on investment, and secondly the low access to high quality data, and accurate information. Yet as easily seen in our graphs below, Africa, and specifically Sub-Saharan Africa has seen a steady increase in their GDP compared to the rest of the world. As the political instability has begun to subside throughout the region many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have been able to develop and industrialize their economy. Many countries have been able to move away from predominantly agriculture and mining based economies to manufacturing and service based economies. Therefore Sub-Saharan Africa has become more open to more complex and sustainable corporate foreign investments over the last decade, and has the potential to shape the global economic landscape as we move forwards and look towards the rest of the 21st century.
        <br> <br>
        Another key reason as to why Sub-Saharan Africa is an attractive investment option is due to the overall steady decline in year over year GDP growth for many developed and developing countries. A principal cause for this is due to the change in the demographic changes in such countries. Many of these countries suffer from an aging population which has a detrimental impact on the growth of the Labor Market. Other demographic indicators such as fertility rates, education, and income inequality have caused these countries’ economies to stagnate or in some instances even decline.  Sub-Saharan Africa on the other hand has seen a significant improvement for these demographic indicators. Many of these countries have an extremely young population, which will help drive the growth of their labor market. Furthermore they have seen an improvement in healthcare, education, and many other demographic metrics which will allow them to sustain an expanding economy.
        <br> <br>
        With the rising economic potential in Sub-Saharan Africa, it is imperative that we close the gap of high quality, accurate socioeconomic data. As stated previously one of the main detriments to investing in this region has been due to the lack of accurate local information.  Many institutions such as USAID, the UN, and World Bank, track country-level information very closely, but accessing local information within a specific country is extremely limited and cumbersome.  Micro data is essential to clearly understanding the economic potential of an investment in a country, and without such information can have a detrimental impact on the sustainability of a foreign corporate investment. Therefore we hope to illustrate through our example below how one can potentially aggregate and model historical trends and project future trends using the limited historical data available. Such models can potentially guide policymakers, both national and international, in making key investment decisions of a critical nature that can benefit the region and its countries.

    <h3 class="title">Why Kenya?</h3>
    <p> Within Sub-Saharan Africa, Kenya would be a prime location for future long term foreign corporate investment due to the changes the country has made in recent years. The country has been able to develop the  right combination of a politically stable environment and government focus on improving key demographics, to  help improve and diversify the economy.
        <br> <br>
        Kenya has made staggering strides in developing the country’s political environment, especially after passing their new constitution in 2010. Their new constitution enacted a bicameral legislative house, devolved county government, and a constitutionally tenured judiciary and electoral body. This was a crucial step towards moving away from historical corruptive government practices, and pushing towards a more decentralized democratic nation.
        <br> <br>
        Furthermore  Kenya has had a significant increase in their younger population over the past decade, and one of the Country’s main objectives is to continue to improve on their ability to provide  better healthcare and education to this younger demographic. This will not only help provide the country a large and more specialized labor force, but also help improve the poverty level seen throughout the country, especially in rural regions.
        <br> <br>
        Even though the country has seen some hardships due to the Ukraine War and the global rise in inflation, it has still been able to limit the negative impact of these outside negative forces in comparison  to many other countries around the world as seen in the CHART BELOW.. Therefore we believe that Kenya  is  a major area of opportunity  to focus on while exploring possible investment opportunities.

    <h3 class="title">Integrity of Historical Data</h3>
    <p> Aggregating sub-national historical data in  Kenya, as well as other countries in sub-Saharan Africa is very difficult due to the numerous governmental and institutional changes that have occurred in the region. There are many global non-profit institutions, such as the UN and the  World Bank,  that collect data on key socioeconomic indicators on a national-level, but there are very few that collect this information on a sub-national level. Yet, as a foreign corporate investor, understanding the local socioeconomic landscape is key to making a sound investment in sub-Saharan Africa.
        <br><br>
        There are a few organizations that have closely watched  and surveyed Kenya’s progress on a sub-national level, such as DHS and KNBS. Although, there are a few key issues regarding the data collection process historically and the hurdles faced when attempting to understand the historical trends of the country’s socioeconomic indicators on a sub-national level. Before 2009, actual reported surveyed data was collected on a province-level, only starting in 2009 (for KNBS Census), and  2009/2014(DHS) were the county-level data reported. This is a crucial issue since in 2010 passed a new constitution that enacted devolved county governments. The other issue is the inconsistency of the type of data collected, they surveyed data differs from year to year. Finally, many other institutions that do provide historical sub-national information tend to estimate using DHS and the UN Projection model. The key issue with using such models is that many of the data points are health focused due to the immense amount of global funding provided to Kenya and other similar countries to improve health care in the region. Many of these indicators are not directly interpreted as an indicator of future economic growth, but as you will see below even such modeled information can indicate the future trend for key economic factors.

    </p>
    <hr>

    <h4 class="title" style="font-size: 18px;">Overview of Models</h4>
    <p> We developed our own custom models to understand the historical county-level trends of some adjusted key economic indicators. <br> <br>
        We used a linear regression model using the KNBS’s reported GCP as a % of Kenya’s Total GCP from 2013 to 2020 to understand the possible historical trend of a county’s  GCP.  <br> <br>
        We used the reported four-year (2017-2020) average sector-level GCP along with the back-casted regressed GCP share of Kenya’s total  GDP to understand the historical sector level trends by county. <br> <br>
        Finally we used the IHME’s  Modeled Average Years of Education based on DHS survey by Gender for an autoregressive model to understand both historical and future trends of education by county. <br> <br>
        Finally we used the UN’s subnational custom r model to project population, TFR, and Demographic Breakdown to the year 2050. We used IHME’s estimated TFR and Mortality Rate  (using  the 5yr average from DHS) as inputs. A key aspect to remember is that we were unable to use the migration parameter due to the fact such information is not available on a local-level, therefore the real modeled value may be slightly higher than the reported value from the KNBS.

<section id="section-why-tool" class="destinations">
    <h3 class="title">Key Drivers</h3>
    <p> Given the very limited sources of accurate data currently available for Kenya (e.g. Garissa’s census crisis,
        high fluctuation of gross county product (GCP) (defined as GDP in county-level terms) in numerous counties
        within Kenya, etc…), our team has decided to focus on bridging the gap to provide representation data
        projections and predictions by building a tool that allows users to incorporate his or her own expectations of a
        country and/or locality into the projection model. With this additional flexibility, users are able to
        understand the projected future economic growth on the county-level in Kenya at a deeper level while factoring
        in their own expectations, which allows key policymakers to plan for potential investments in key counties in
        the near future in a continent that’s been a critical focus for global growth.

    <p> Key applications of our tool include identifying which age groups of the population in Kenya contribute and/or matter the most to GCP and/or GDP growth in the near future, which allows users to extract interesting information and insights derived from our tool that would benefit from further exploration to better understand the future of the socioeconomic status of Kenya on a re more granular level to inform both current and future decision-making of all granularities and scales..</p>

<!--            <p>This county has seen the largest increase GVA from 2000 to 2020, even though it is landlocked. This increase is because the county, centered around agriculture, has gone from 1% of Kenya's total agricultural production to 4%. Farmers in the county cite a significant improvement in farming tactics, like using fertilizer and manure, while decreased costs of raw materials as the source of the gain. Agriculture service offices are providing farmers with knowledge on how to improve their farming practices using western research. However, some constraints on logistics, like poor roads, limit the distribution of goods leading to wasted crops. Investments in technology that can improve agriculture logistics while improving the reach of services offices guiding farmers in other counties could significantly strengthen Kenya's agricultural economy.</p>        </li>-->

Kenya has taken a strong stance on bolstering education, rolling out a Free primary education program in 2003 and revamping its curriculum in 2017, supplying students with more key materials like books. However, resources like teachers can be scarce, where large teacher-student ratios are common. Further focusing on educational supplies and incentivizing individuals to become teachers through student loan forgiveness programs could ameliorate educational resource constraints.</p>        </li>-->
